# Microsoft MPI

Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI) is a Microsoft implementation of the [Message Passing Interface standard](https://www.mpi-forum.org) for developing and running parallel applications on the Windows platform.

MS-MPI offers several benefits:

  - Ease of porting existing code that uses [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org).
  - Security based on Active Directory Domain Services.
  - High performance on the Windows operating system.
  - Binary compatibility across different types of interconnectivity options.

## Version of MPI standard 

MS-MPI is MPI 2.2 compliant with the exception of Fortran bindings errata around attributes interop between C and Fortran. MS-MPI implements a subset of features from MPI 3.1 standard:
  - Non-blocking collectives,
  - RMA,
  - MPI shared memory,
  - New datatypes,
  - Large counts,
  - Matched probe.

For the full list of APIs please see [Microsoft MPI Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi).

## MS-MPI downloads

The following are current downloads for MS-MPI:

  - [MS-MPI v10.1.2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=100593) (new\!) - see [Release notes](microsoft-mpi-release-notes.md)
  - The MS-MPI SDK is also available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/msmpisdk/).

Earlier versions of MS-MPI are available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=390734).

# Building

## Prerequisites

 - [Visial Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)

   Please make sure to select the following workloads during installation:
    - .NET desktop development (required for CBT/Nuget packages)
    - Desktop development with C++ 

 - [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
 - [Windows WDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)
 - [GFortran](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php)
    - Update _GFORTRAN_BIN_ in Derectory.Build.props to the install location of GFortran
 - [Perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html#win32)

Note that the build system uses [CommonBuildToolSet(CBT)](https://commonbuildtoolset.github.io/). You may need to unblock __CBT.core.dll__ (under .build/CBT) depending on your security configurations. Please refer to [CBT documentation](https://commonbuildtoolset.github.io/#/getting-started) for additional details.


## Build
To build, open a __Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio__ and  run ``msbuild /p:WindowsTargetPlatformVersion=<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion> /p:PlatformToolset=<PlatformToolset>`` from root folder, where `<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>` and `<PlatformToolset>` should be selected based on your installed VS/SDK/WDK versions.
